### This repository will accomplish a few goals:

 - Standardize how Climate data is pulled and transformed into H3
 - Integrate disparate sustainability datasets and link them to the finances of a business or asset.
 - Produce and open-source risk scores for common perils: tornado, hail, snow, wildfire, and hurricane.
 - Publish statistics used in the actuarial and underwriting process

 - Below is an 90-year history of Tornadoes in the Continential US and 
 - shows a map layer of Uber H3 hexagonds (resolution 9, or ~110m^2 geographic resolution)
 - each hexagon contains the `average_frequency` calulcation
 - actuaries and underwriters often use to caluclate the expected loss or payout of an insurance policy.

### Simply intersect your real estate data to this layer and you now have the Tornado history of any real estate in the US.
