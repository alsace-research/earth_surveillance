#### Pipeline for Tornado History -> H3 -> Statistics by H3


#### To get started:

1. Run ```01. get_history_tornado.ipynb``` - This will download the Tornado data.
   - It will save a file located at ```data/tornado_history.shp```
2. Run ```02.get_h3_hexagons.ipynb``` - This will generate an Uber H3 map layer using US States.
